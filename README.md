# BattleShip

This is basic, array based implementation of Battle Ship Game. A player will places 5 of their ships on a 10 by 10 grid. Then the computer player deploys five ships on the same grid. Once the game starts the player and computer take turns, trying to sink each other's ships by guessing the coordinates. The game ends when either the player or computer has no ships left.
